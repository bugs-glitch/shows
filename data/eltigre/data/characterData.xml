	<character name="Manny Rivera" aka="El Tigre" copy="For the most part, Manny Rivera is a well-meaning kid with the energy and the spirit of a hero. But Manny is no goody-two-shoes. He's also got some serious supervillain potential.  When he spins his mystical belt buckle, Manny transforms into the brave and powerful El Tigre, who struggles with whether to use his superpowers for good or evil. And sometimes evil wins. At times Manny will do the wrong things for the right reasons, at other times he'll do the wrong thing for the wrong reasons, and sometimes he'll even do the right thing for the right reasons. But mostly he's just looking for new and exciting adventures for himself and his best friend, Frida." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/elTigreIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/elTigre.swf"></character>
	<character name="Rodolfo Rivera" aka="White Pantera" copy="Manny's father Rodolfo is a good old-fashioned dad, complete with rules and orders that Manny doesn't always follow. Although Rodolfo was once the greatest superhero Miracle City has ever seen (thanks to his Bronze Boots of Truth), he's since semi-retired and is focusing these days on fatherhood and his regular 9-5 job. That is unless there's a major emergency, in which case Rodolfo will become White Pantera in  a pinch. Rodolfo has a love-hate relationship with his dad, Manny's Granpapi, who just so happens to be the evil villain Puma Loco. Despite their differences and Grandpapi's desire to pull Manny over to the dark side,  Rodolfo always puts his family first." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/whitePanteraIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/whitePantera.swf"></character>
	<character name="Granpapi Rivera" aka="Puma Loco" copy="Granpapi Rivera is a friendly old man who loves his grandson Manny very much. And he also happens to be evil to the core.  Back in the day, Granpapi was the super-scary supervillain Puma Loco. With his Sombrero of Chaos, no one could catch Puma Loco...no one but his own son, White Pantera, that is. These days Granpapi is retired, or so he says. He'll still pull off the occasional billion dollar heist, but only a few times a day. Granpapi never shies away from mischief,  especially if it means spending time with Manny. Who else is going to show him just how much fun it is to be bad?" icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/pumaLocoIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/pumaLoco.swf"></character>
	<character name="Frida Suarez" copy="Frida is the best friend a guy could have...but she's not always the best influence on Manny.  She's always  got his back when he's in trouble, but it's usually Frida who leads him down  questionable and dangerous paths that he might otherwise (barely) avoid to begin with. Frida is up for just about anything and isn't phased at all by the superhero/supervillain stuff. When she's not causing mischief with Manny, Frida can be found focusing on her band, the Atomic Sombreros." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/fridaIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/frida.swf"></character>
	<character name="Sartana of the Dead" copy="Sartana of the Dead is the  most dangerous, most devious and most feared villain in all of Miracle City.  From her lair in the abandoned prison cemetery, the 200-year-old skeleton lady Sartana plots to overthrow all living beings and claim Miracle City for herself. She totally despises El Tigre, and all Rivera men for that matter, especially Manny's Grandpapi, Puma Loco...who just so happens to be her former sweetie. By strumming her golden guitar of doom, Sartana can summon countless skeletons from the ground to aid in her attempts to wipe out Miracle City.  Perhaps the scariest thing about Sartana is the fact that she can never truly  be destroyed and always finds a way to come back to life. Which usually means  more trouble for El Tigre..." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/sartanaIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/sartana.swf"></character>
	<character name="Sergio" aka="Senor Siniestro" copy="Sergio is a very small 13-year-old boy who recently moved to Miracle City from Italy. On his first day at Leone Middle School, he foolishly wore his beloved cowboy costume, complete with broomstick-horsey. Humiliation, unintentionally led by Manny, ensued and Sergio swore revenge on Miracle City, especially Manny. Sergio's supervillain suit of choice is a 10-foot tall robot suit. When inside the suit, he's unrecognizable and poses as an adult cowboy supervillain Senor Siniestro. Sergio also builds other cowboy robots to assist him in his villainous adventures. Senor Siniestro is usually found spewing cowboy lingo in an absurdly inaccurate Texas accent while looking for his foe, Manny Rivera." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/sergioIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/sergio.swf"></character>
	<character name="Zoe Aves" aka="Black Cuervo" copy="By day Zoe is an average teenager who's totally down in the dumps and disinterested in life in general.  But Zoe's family is anything but average, they're a clan of supervillains known as the Flock of Fury. Just like the Riveras all have feline alteregos, the Flock of Fury is made up of birdie baddies. When the sun sets on Miracle City, Zoe secretly becomes the evil supervillain Black Cuervo, a kick-butt, take-charge girl who is much more outgoing and full of life than Zoe. Black Cuervo is a force to be reckoned with, equipped with a laser blaster on her wrist and jet-wings on her back.  Zoe's got an evil Mom named Voltura and  a REALLY evil grandmami known as Lady Gobbler. The three generations of Aves have tangled with the Riveras in the past, and will most definitely meet up with them in the future..." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/blackCuervoIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/blackCuervo.swf"></character>
	<character name="Diego" aka="Dr. Chipotle Jr." copy="Like his dad, Dr. Chipotle Sr., 10-year-old Dr. Chipotle Jr. is a mad scientist with a massive robotic metal arm.  Chipotle Jr. has been known to make some pretty mean monsters using some pretty weird materials (guacamole and jalapenos, anyone?).  When Chipotle Jr. was just 7, he watched El Tigre and White Pantera put his dad in jail, and he swore he'd get back at them some day. Now he is totally and completely obsessed with making El Tigre suffer.  Unfortunately for Jr., El Tigre never remembers who he is, and he probably wouldn't take him seriously anyway since he's just a little kid. Which is endlessly frustrating to Chipotle Jr.!" icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/chipotleIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/chipotle.swf"></character>
	<character name="El Oso" copy="El Oso is a big, dumb hairy thug. His name means ''the bear'' and that's pretty much all you need to know about him.  Except for the fact that he lives on the outskirts of Miracle City in Calavera, the criminal capital of the world. (Calavera is so tough that its team mascot is a broken leg!) El Oso spends most of his time wreaking havoc in Miracle City, however, and what he lacks in brains he makes up for in tenacity and strength. No matter how many times El Tigre or White Pantera put El Oso behind bars, he manages to break out in time for dinner." icon="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/icons/osoIcon.swf" image="/shows/data/eltigre/multimedia/elt/characters/oso.swf"></character>
